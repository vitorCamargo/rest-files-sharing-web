## More Informations
This project is developed using the programming language NodeJS. And it was developed by [Gabriel Sacca](https://github.com/Gabrields1998) and [Vitor Camargo](https://github.com/vitorCamargo), students of the Bachelor of Computer Science course at the Federal Technological University of Paran√° - campus Campo Mour√£o (UTFPR-CM). This program was developed in the semester 2019/2, for the discipline Compilers, taught by Professor [Rodrigo Campiolo](https://github.com/campiolo), from the Computing Department of UTFPR-CM (DACOM).

### Team

### Interface
- Sign up user;
- Login System for users (using email or username);
- Edit profile or delete it;
- Directory System:
  - Private File System;
  - Public (Sharing) File System;
  - Global File System (Anyone can use);

It's possible in any Directory System:
- Add new files, images, movies and blobs;
- Update the files or directories;
- Also remove and see them;
- move files between the directories;

It's possible to sharing a file with another user by their email or username;

### Architecture
The users is going to use the system through a web application using ReactJS. The architecture of project has a client/server structure, the server will have a connection (using REST API) with a database, which one, will keep the path for the files and directories, and a connection with a blob server (using Cloudinary API).
